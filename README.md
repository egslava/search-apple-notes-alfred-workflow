# Search Apple Notes (Alfred Workflow)

It's a dump of amazing [Alfred Search Notes app](https://github.com/sballin/alfred-search-notes-app) workflow. They are moving towards Golang now and I'm afraid it's gonna stop working or can just get more buggy. I'm pretty satisfied with the project right now, so I'm leaving this public dump here.

To install, just download the file and double click it.
